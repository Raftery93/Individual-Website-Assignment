						<h2>History of the Army Reserve</h2>
					</hgroup>
							<h3>1940</h3>
								<p>
									In June 1940, following the outbreak of World War II, the Volunteer Reserve that was officially
									established in 1929 was renamed the Local Security Force (LSF). The "Emergency Powers Order" gave 
									official authority for the establishment of this force and was described in Article 54 of this Order
									as the "Temporary Special Police Force." This Force, incorporating a Defence Force and a Police Force
									with the role of securing Ireland’s 26 counties was created from a network of volunteers in every locality
									who carried out local security duties and reported any hostility to the Force’s controlling authority, An Garda SÁochána.
									The LSF, based in each Garda SÁochána district, were broken into a number of service groups, including Intelligence & Organisation,
									Communications, Transport, Engineer, Supply, First Aid and a Combat Group. Within three months of its formation, the LSF’s strength
									had grown to 180,000, most of who had requested to serve with the Combat Group — as members of this group were armed and tasked with
									defending the main installations of each district.<br>
								</p>
							<h3>1941 - 1946</h3>
								<p>
									By January 1941 the LSF’s Combat Group had grown beyond all expected proportions. To ease this problem and ensure that
									full training was afforded to all, the Combat Group was placed under the control of the Defence Forces and became known
									as the Local Defence Forces (LDF). Organised into Rifle Battalions and commanded by Army Officers, the roles of the new
									force became more military focussed.
								</p>
							<h3>1946 - 1984</h3>
								<p>
									In 1946 the LDF was reorganised again, under a new title, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil (An FCÁ — the Local Defence Forces)
									An FCÁ integrated with the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) in 1959. This move revitalised An FCÁ, as the Local Defence Force was restructured 
									to mirror the PDF. Rifle Battalions were reformed as Infantry Battalions, their training and weapons were upgraded. From 1969 onwards FCÁ personnel
									supported the PDF by the provision of security duties in barracks and posts throughout the country.
								</p>
							<h3>1984 - 1996</h3>
								<p>
									In 1984, shortly after the 25th anniversary of integration, An FCÁ was de-integrated and re-established as an independent Reserve Force.
									The structure set in place at the time has continued the same and An FCÁ has continued with its normal training.
									FCÁ units were the most visible part of the Defence Forces in many localities throughout the country. Regularly carrying out ceremonial
									duties, Presidential Guards, and guards of honour, as well as participating in local and national St. Patrick’s Day Parades, FCÁ personnel
									made themselves available during local emergencies providing help to the needy and assistance to the PDF for security duties, military exercises
									and in support for major operations.

							<h3>1996 - 2004</h3>
								<p>
									In 1996 a military board was established under Colonel Des Travers to look at the possibilities of restructuring the FCÁ and re-integrating
									the organisation into the PDF. Arising from the report of this board a Steering Group was set up consisting of members of the Department
									of Defence, PDF and FCÁ personnel, including Brigadier General Edmund Heskin, then General Officer Commanding the 2 Eastern Brigade,
									and Colonel Mick Dunne, then Director of Reserve Forces. The Steering Board’s final report was used as a basis for the recommendations 
									contained in the Government’s White Paper on Defence 2000. The White Paper stated, “Ireland provides for its core defence requirements
									through the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF). The availability of supplementary forces, in the form of reserves, offers a cost effective means 
									of achieving an overall strength target through a judicious combination of standing and Reserve Forces, the Reserves should be organised and
									equipped on a similar basis to regular forces in order to develop the interoperability necessary to train and conduct joint operations.”
									To achieve this, and arising from the Steering Board report, the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board (RDFRIB) was established. Chaired by Brigadier 
									General Frederic Swords, the RDFRIB reported in 2002. It recommended the establishment of a Reserve containing integrated and non-integrated elements.
								</p>
							<h3>2004 - 2012</h3>
								<p>
									On July 26th 2004, all of the hard work carried out by the RDFRIB culminated with Mr Michael Smith, TD, and then the Minister for Defence
									approving the RDF Review Implementation Plan, based on the RDFRIB report. The new organisation which came into effect on the 1st October
									2005 will update and change the face of the Reserve, making it a more modern and integratable force. The new non-integrated reserve organisation
									mirrors that of the present PDF structure with three Reserve Infantry Brigades.
								</p>
							<h3>2013</h3>
								<p>
									The formation of an integrated reserve will be fully immersed with their PDF parent units. These integrated personnel will
									have a much more dedicated training regime, training alongside their PDF comrades, under the command and control of their PDF unit commander.
									This integration is currently in the process of being formed. The scheduled timeline will be constantly monitored by the Monitoring Group,
									to ensure the plan maintains momentum and this initiative is known as the “One Force” concept.
									The Reserve Force must now focus on training to a standard that will enable them to rapidly attain interoperability with the PDF, should the need arise.
									The new integrated Army Reserve is a vastly different organisation to that of, An FCÁ. While building on the strengths of the old organisation,
									the Army Reserve will have a more meaningful and challenging role. Equipment has been improved and increased resources have been made available.
									The commitment and enthusiasm of the volunteer reservists has been the foundation on which the old FCÁ was built and these traits allied to 
									the enhanced training and a clearer focus will continue to ensure the success of the Army Reserve.

						<h2>Training in the Army Reserve</h2>
					</hgroup>
							<p>Training is the life blood of the Reserve Defence Force. The part time soldier, or sailor, receives modern training, centered around weekly training parades,
								which are usually 2 hours in duration. There are also field-days, and overnights, usually once a month, along with a full-time training camp in the summer 
								which is of up to 14 days in duration.
							</p>
						<br>
							<p>
								In the Army Reserve, every person is first and foremost a soldier and the training that they receive in their first few years reflects this.
								Every person who joins the Reserve must undergo the same recruit training. The development of the average person into a motivated and capable soldier
								is the goal of recruit training. In recruit training, soldiers undergo training in combat first aid, organisation of the Defence Forces, military 
								law and tactical training. A major part of Recruit training is training in the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle.
