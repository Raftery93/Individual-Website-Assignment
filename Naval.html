					<h3>A Brief History</h3>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
					Tracing its roots back to 1913 and the very founding of the state the Irish Army has played a massive part in the creation and 
					development of the Republic of Ireland.  However the states water’s were controlled by the British Admiralty from 1922 till 1938
					when Great Britain handed back the Treaty Ports and control of Irish waters, to the Irish Free State. The government, in May 1939,
					ordered 2 Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB’s) from Great Britain.
					The entire process of raising some type of Navy was greatly accelerated by the outbreak of World War II as Ireland needed to have
					its own Navy to uphold its neutrality. The order for MTBs was increased from 2 to 6 and the Marine and Coast watching Service was
					established in September 1939 (the Coast watching function was removed in 1942).
