						<h2>History</h2>
					</hgroup>
					<p>The Air Corps is the air component of the Permanent Defence Forces, based at Casement Aerodrome,
					Baldonnel, Co. Dublin. Today, approximately 750 men and women serve in the Air Corps, each making a
					unique and significant contribution to fulfilling the roles, both primary and secondary as assigned	by government.
					<br/>
					The Air Corps has recently completed a major fleet upgrade programme whereby many of its older aircraft have been replaced
					by modern, state of the art military aircraft. This in turn has allowed for increased efficiency, increased output and
					significant improved capabilities as we progress through the 21st century.
					<br/>
					The Air Corps currently operates 17 fixed wing aircraft and 10 rotary wing aircraft along with two simulators; a PC-9M
					and a multi-crew trainer.
