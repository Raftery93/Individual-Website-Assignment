						<h2>Who are the Defence Forces Ireland?</h2>
					</hgroup>
					<p>We are the military of Ireland, known as the Defence Forces, it encompass<br/>
			the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, and Reserve Defence Force.<br/>
			The Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces is the President of Ireland. <br/>
			All Defence Forces officers hold their commission from the <br/>
			President, but in practice the Minister for Defence acts on the President's<br/>
			behalf and reports to the Government of Ireland. The Minister<br/>
			for Defence is advised by the Council of Defence on the business of the <br/>
			Department of Defence.<br/>
			The Irish Defence Forces trace their origins to the Irish Volunteers founded<br/>
			in 1913.The Defence Forces official title, Óglaigh na hÉireann, is taken from<br/>
			the official Irish language title of the Irish Volunteers. Volunteers took part<br/>
			in the 1916 Easter Rising. After the rising the Volunteers gave allegiance to the<br/>
			First Dáil. At this time the Volunteers became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA).<br/>
			The IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against British rule in Ireland between 1919 and 1921.<br/>
			A truce brought hostilities to an end on 11 July 1921 and the Anglo-Irish Treaty was <br/>
			signed on 6 December. The Provisional Government was then constituted on 14 January 1922.<br/>
			Many IRA men who fought in the War of Independence were dissatisfied with the Treaty and<br/>
			both Civil War or reoccupation by the British were possible. In February 1922, the Provisional<br/>
			Government began to recruit volunteers into the new Irish National Army. The Irish<br/>
			Civil War began on 28 June 1922 between the Republican Anti-treaty IRA and the newly<br/>
			recruited pro-treaty National Army. The Civil War ended on 24 May 1923, the IRA Chief<br/>
			of Staff ordered IRA volunteers to dump arms and the new Irish Free State slipped<br/>
			into an uneasy peace.<br/>
			<br/>
			On 3 August 1923 the new state passed the "Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act", raising<br/>
			"an armed force to be called Oglaigh na hEireann (hereinafter referred to as the Forces) <br/>
			consisting of such number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men as may from time <br/>
			to time be provided by the Oireachtas." The establishment of the Forces was on 1 <br/>
			October 1924. From then on they were known as the Defence Forces of Ireland.<br/>

						<h2>What do the Defence Forces Ireland do?</h2>

					<p>The Defence Forces’ mission is: “To contribute
			to the security of the State by providing for the
			military defence of its territorial integrity and

			the deployment of well-motivated and effective
			Defence Forces.” When not actually engaged in operations,
			the object is to train in order to achieve the degree of
			operational effectiveness, which our ethos and our assigned roles demand.

			The Defence Forces position is unique in terms of its learning output with
			personnel undergoing training and education courses on a continuous basis.
			As a consequence, it fully supports the recognition of life long learning.

			conducted within the organisation through collaboration with appropriate
			Higher Education Institutions.</p>
